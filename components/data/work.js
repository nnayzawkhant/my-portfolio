            The Admin Component has been built using the React.js library and is responsible for managing the website's content and users.
            The Website Component, built with Next.js, handles the rendering of the website's front-end, providing users with an optimized and seamless browsing experience.
            The REST API Component is built on Node.js and is responsible for managing the website's data and communicating with other web services.
            By leveraging the power of these three technologies, the website is able to deliver a robust and reliable news platform that is optimized for speed, security, and user engagement.`,
